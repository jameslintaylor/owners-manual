# My owner's manual

If you work with me, you may find this document useful.

## Why this document?

It's a valuable exercise in introspection.  It is also my part in what
serves as a start towards understanding and defining the interface
between teammates, as contributors to a common cause.  Also, my
manager told me to do it.

## What I love doing

- Thinking about how to write good code.  There are several ways to
  achieve the same piece of functionality, and finding that which
  strikes the right balance of performance, elegance, and readability
  is a great deal of fun to me.

- Designing good interfaces.  No matter who the end user is, I find a
  lot of joy in designing the means by which a user might interact
  with a system efficiently and intuitively.
  
## How I tend to work
  
- Getting away from the computer screen.  With a monitor's backlight
  burning an emacs window into my retina, and the tease of a
  mechanical keyboard at my fingertips, it becomes hard to take a step
  back and think about the direction in which I am headed.  An hour
  spent on a long walk is often far more valuable than an hour
  clacking away at a keyboard.
  
- Pair/Mob programming.  I enjoy the process of problem solving and
  sharing knowledge with peers while being mutually invested in a
  problem.  It's hard to have that experience elsewhere.
  
- Building up pace.  I want to start work a project slow and
  thoughtfully, and finish fast and triumphantly.  Sprinting out of
  the gate will only burn me out.
  
## How I work best with others

- I collaborate best when all parties are open minded.  I have
  opinions, but am not tied to them.  I expect the same from my peers.
  
- I am most comfortable when the situation at hand is not taken overly
  seriously.  I won't dismiss a real crisis, but making a big deal out
  of nothing just gets in the way of calm and collected thought.
  
## How I communicate

- I do my best to be direct.  However, being direct has the tendency
  to come off as curt and abrasive.  I will always opt to make sure
  that the person I am talking to knows they are respected.
  
- If I'm passionate about what I'm speaking about, I won't hide my
  emotions.
  
## What I value

- **Respect**.  It should go without saying.  You don't have to earn
  my respect, nor should you care that I respect you.

- **Laughing**.  It feels good.  If we can make a joke out of it,
  that's a good thing.

- **Conversation**.  Let's not pretend like our work is our life.
  Let's talk about your weekend, and after that we can talk about
  work, if you want.

- **Space**.  I am not at my best when I feel trapped.  Whether it be
  a rigid schedule, a tired way of thinking, or external pressure,
  feeling trapped does nothing for my personal wellbeing, nor the work
  I produce.  Idealistic? Definitely.
  
## What I don't value

- **Elitism**.  I will not entertain any attempt at gatekeeping, whether
  that which is being kept out are people or their ideas.
  
- **Finger pointing**.  No one individual is wholly responsible for any
  change in a system.  `git blame` is valuable for the commit message,
  not the author.
  
- **Ceremony**, Unless we're all having a good time.
